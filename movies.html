                <h1>10 Things I Hate About You</h1>
                <br>
                <p>Kat Stratford is beautiful, smart and quite abrasive to most of her fellow teens, meaning that she doesn't attract many boys. Unfortunately for her younger sister, Bianca, house rules say that she can't date until Kat has a boyfriend, so strings are pulled to set the dour damsel up for a romance. Soon Kat crosses paths with handsome new arrival Patrick Verona. Kat may let her guard down enough to fall for the effortlessly charming Patrick.</p>
